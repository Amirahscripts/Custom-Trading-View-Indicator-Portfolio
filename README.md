# Custom-Trading-View-Indicator-Portfolio
Collection of Trading View indicators I have created and currently back testing. Here I showcase my skills in understanding financial modelling using statistics- standard deviation, mean absolute deviation and coding in Python and Pinescript.

HVE- Historical Volatility Indicator 
The "Historical Volatility Estimators (HVE)" indicator calculates the historical volatility of an asset using either the EWMA or Mean Absolute Deviation model. 
It provides visual cues like arrows, flashes, and background colours to help users interpret the volatility data. The user can customize the parameters of the indicator, such as the length for calculations, the annual period, and the percentile length.
